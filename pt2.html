    <h1>Breakthrough Is Reported in Gandhi Murder</h1>
    <h2>By Bernard Weinraub</h2>
    <h3>June 15, 1991</h3>

    <p>
        Government investigators said today that the arrest of a mother and son in Madras on Tuesday night in connection with the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a significant breakthrough and that they now believed the killing was a carefully planned conspiracy that may have involved at least a dozen people.
        <br>
        <br>At the same time, officials said that a bespectacled man photographed at the scene of the assassination is the object of a nationwide search and believed to be the mastermind behind the killing of Mr. Gandhi on May 21.
        <br>
        <br>Officials said the man, in his 30's, fled the scene of the assassination together with at least two women, believed to be accomplices.
        <br>
        <br>Government investigators said tonight that the two women, identified only as Nalini and Murugan, were seized late today near Madras.
